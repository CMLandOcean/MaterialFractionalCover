The Spectral Library of impervious Urban Materials Version 1.0 (SLUM; Kotthaus 2013; Kotthaus et al. 2014) available from the London Urban Micromet data Archive (LUMA; https://zenodo.org/record/4263842) 
consists of 74 material samples and covers the wavelength region from 300 to 2500 nm. 
Endmembers are structured in “superclass”, “class”, and “material”. “material”, however, may include conglomerates or mixtures of two or more pure materials.

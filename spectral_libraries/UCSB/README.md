# Santa Barbara Urban Spectral Library

A very comprehensive and extensively used SLI is the Urban SLI from Santa Barbara (UCSB, Herold et al. 2004) available in the Ecological Spectral Information System (EcoSIS). 
It covers the wavelength region between 400 and 2500 nm and consists of 1065 field spectra measured with an ASD FieldSpec 3 in California. The SLI is structured in 7 levels. The classes, however, often do not match the proposed list of materials in Table 1 but rather describe land use type or how a certain type of material has been used.
The UCSB SLI is a single csv file consisting of 1065 spectra structured in 7 levels of which the last one (Level_7) has all relevant information. We reclassified Level_7 to match the desired classification according to Table A2.1.
